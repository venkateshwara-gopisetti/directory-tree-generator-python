# directory_tree
Build a Python Directory Tree Generator for the Command Line.



Based on this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/directory-tree-generator-python/) from **Leodanis Pozo Ramos** from [Realpython](https://realpython.com/)

In the project’s root directory, you’ll find the following files:

- README.md provides the project description and instructions on installing and running the application. Adding a descriptive and detailed README file to your projects is considered a best practice in programming, especially if you’re planning to release the project as an open source solution.


There are 3 implementations of the directory tree generator -
 - [**rptree**](\rptree\rptree.md) - A direct implementation of the RealPython tutorial as mentioned above.
 - [**rptree_alt**](\rptree_alt\rptree_alt.md) - A standalone implementation of the rptree module, loosely based on the **rptree** implementation.
 - [**treewalk**](\treewalk\treewalk.md) [WIP] - A similar functionality implemented based on python os.walk method.

- tree.py provides an entry-point script for the user to run the application. This directs you to the **rptree** implementation.
- alt_tree.py provides access to the **rptree_alt** implementation.
