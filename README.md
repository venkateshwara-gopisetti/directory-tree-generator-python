# directory_tree
Build a Python Directory Tree Generator for the Command Line.



Based on this [tutorial](https://realpython.com/directory-tree-generator-python/) from **Leodanis Pozo Ramos** from [Realpython](https://realpython.com/)

In the project’s root directory, you’ll find the following files:

- README.md provides the project description and instructions on installing and running the application. Adding a descriptive and detailed README file to your projects is considered a best practice in programming, especially if you’re planning to release the project as an open source solution.

- tree.py provides an entry-point script for you to run the application. There are 3 separate APIs to call. The script takes the API name/alias as parameter to invoke that particular function. [WIP]

There are 3 implementations of the directory tree generator -
 - **rptree** - A direct implementation of the RealPython tutorial as mentioned above.
 - **rptree_alt** - A standalone implementation of the rptree module.
 - **treewalk** - A similar functionality implemented based on python os.walk method.
