In the project’s root directory, you’ll find the following files:

- README.md provides the project description and instructions on installing and running the application. Adding a descriptive and detailed README file to your projects is considered a best practice in programming, especially if you’re planning to release the project as an open source solution.

- tree.py provides an entry-point script for you to run the application.

Then you have the rptree/ directory that holds a Python package with three modules:
- rptree.py provides the application’s main functionalities.
- \_\_init__.py enables rptree/ as a Python package.
- cli.py provides the command-line interface for the application.
